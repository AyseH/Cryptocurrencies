Cryptocurrency Analysis with Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

'Accountability Accounting' is an investment bank which is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. This report seeks to determine the cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how they can be grouped together to create a classification system for this new investment. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a method of dimension reduction and employ unsupervised machine learning algorithm-K-means-to cluster the cryptocurrencies. The results are visualized using 3D and 2D scatter plots and tables.
